# 句子
# Big Data
 **1.** *It is necessary to perform ==sub-micron imaging== of ==model animals such as mouse== in the ==whole brain== for neuron reconstruction.The amount of whole brain data used for neuron reconstruction is ==as high as 10 TB== due to the ==extremely high voxel resolution== and ==large sample size==, which brings huge storage and transmission pressure to neuron reconstruction.**(亚微米成像带来大数据问题)** *


**2.**  *the problem of saving a large amount of data ==without neuron signal==.**（无用数据块）** *

**3.**  *Whole brain data is essentially a massive amount of three-dimensional image data.**（数据本质）** *



# Conclusion
  **1.** *In summary, the whole brain data compression strategy proposed in this study can ==quickly complete the compression== of the whole brain data, and can retain most of the neuron signals while ensuring a ==high compression rate==. It can ==effectively alleviate the transmission and storage pressure== caused by massive data, and improve the efficiency of neuron reconstruction.**（从最终效果，达成目的否等总结）** *
